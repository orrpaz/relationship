# relationship

We define a *direct relation* between two people as follows: Person A is directly related to
person B if either their full name and/or address are exactly equal (case-sensitive).


We define an *n-level relation* between person A and person B if you can reach from person A
to person B in exactly n direct relation hops. 1-level relation is a direct relation.


Implemented a utility that finds the minimal relation level between two people.
